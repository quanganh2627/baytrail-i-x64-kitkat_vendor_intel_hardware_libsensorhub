            -r, --date-rate          unit is Hz
            -d, --buffer-delay       unit is ms, i.e. 1/1000 second

2 Libsensorhub API
    5.1 definition
        - libsensorhub API is defined at src/include/libsensorhub.h
    5.2 usage
        - refer to test case code at src/tests/sensor_hub_client.c

3 Supported features, sensors
    6.1 supported features
        - START_STREAMING: data rate and buffer delay can be set. Data rate unit is Hz; buffer delay unit is ms.
        - STOP_STREAMING: stop the streamed data reporting
        - GET_SINGLE: get single current data
    6.2 supported sensors
        - physical accelerometer sensor
        - physical gyroscope sensor
        - physical compass sensor
        - physical barometer sensor
        - physical ALS sensor
        - physical proximity sensor
        - terminal context sensor
        - physical activity sensor
        - gesture spotting sensor
        - gesture flick sensor

4 Measured data transmission latency in sensorhubd (need to be done every time the code related to data dispatching is modified)
    8.0 latest test date: 2011.12.30
    8.1 test method
        - record start_time when data is available on sysfs data node
        - record end_time after data is sent to all target clients
        - (end_time - start_time) is the data transmission latency in sensorhubd
        - current time is get by gettimeofday(); and unit is usec, i.e. 1/1000000 second
        - the overhead of 2 gettimeofday() and 2 write() to file to record time costs about 380us.
    8.2 test scenario 1
        - 3 clients: ./sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 1 -d 1000; ./sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 10 -d 1000; /data/sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 5 -d 1000
        - result: 90% latency is between (220, 420)us, i.e. less than 1/1000 second. Max latency is about 1000us with less than 1% possibility.
    8.3 test scenario 2
        - 4 clients: ./sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 1 -d 1000; ./sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 10 -d 1000; /data/sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 5 -d 1000; ./sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 5 -d 0
        - result: 90% latency is between (220, 420)us, i.e. less than 1/1000 second. Max latency is about 1000us with less than 1% possibility
        - note: "./sensorhub_client -t 0 -r 5 -d 0" is the same as the request made by Android sensor HAL

5 Calibration Setting Application install
    10.1 For ICS:
         - cd <root-of-Android-source-tree>/packages/apps/Settings/src/com/android/settings
         - git fetch git://android.intel.com/a/aosp/platform/packages/apps/Settings refs/changes/87/55687/1 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
         - mm
         - adb remount
         - adb push <root-of-Android-source-tree>/out/target/product/mfld_pr2/system/app/Settings.apk /system/app
         - adb reboot
    10.1 For JellyBean:
         - open psh_sensor_calibration_jni.cpp in directory: <libsensorhub-root>/src/jni_lib/
         - uncomment "#define FOR_JELLYBEAN" and rebuild libPSHSensorCal_JNI.so, and push it to pr3 device.
         - cd <root-of-Android-source-tree>/vendor/intel/apps/SensorCal
         - git fetch git://android.intel.com/a/bsp/vendor/intel/apps/SensorCal refs/changes/06/63206/1 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
         - mm
         - adb remount
         - adb push <root-of-Android-source-tree>/out/target/product/mfld_pr2/system/app/SensorCal.apk /system/app
         - adb reboot
